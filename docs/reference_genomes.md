# Reference genomes

Reference genomes for *C. auris* clades were selected from [Suphavilai *et al*., Discovery of the sixth *Candida auris* clade in Singapore (medRxiv)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.08.01.23293435) and include two (nearly) completed genomes per clade, if freely available from NCBI. For Clade V only one (nearly) complete genome was available from NCBI. Related species were selected from figure 3 of [Mu√±oz *et al*., Genomic insights into multidrug-resistance, mating and virulence in *Candida auris* and related emerging species (NatComm)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-07779-6). Representative genomes were downloaded from NCBI. The sketch was constructed using sketch size 50,000 and k-mer size 27.

If you are missing new clades or have other reference genomes that would be good to include, please open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/RIVM-bioinformatics/auriclass/issues).

The following reference genomes are included in the default database:
